# Mind-Mate-AI
The main goal of AI mental health chatbot is to provide users with a convenient and accessible way 
to receive mental health care support. Developed a chat bot using OpenAI's Text Davinci 003 model, 
integrated with Flask to create a web interface. Incorporated YouTube links for reference and 
implemented a feature to fetch random quotes every 5 seconds using a random quotes API.
